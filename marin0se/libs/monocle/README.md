# Monocle

### Debugging Love2D, in *style*

Monocle is a way to easily watch things while you play your game. 
It's easy to implement, and easy to understand. The setup of a basic main.lua file is as follows:

```lua
require 'monocle/monocle'
Monocle.new({})

-- The most basic way to watch any expression or variable:
Monocle.watch("FPS", function() return math.floor(1/love.timer.getDelta()) end)

function love.update(dt)
	Monocle.update()
end

function love.draw()
	Monocle.draw()
end

function love.textinput(t)
	Monocle.textinput(t)
end

function love.keypressed(text)
	Monocle.keypressed(text)
end
```
Easy as that! When the game is run, what you're watching will show up in the top right of the screen.
