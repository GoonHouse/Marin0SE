Marin0SE
========

A special edition for a special audience!

Marin0SE is a fork of [Mari0](https://github.com/Stabyourself/mari0). The code was refactored to be more moddable than the original game.

Check out the [Marin0SE Wiki](https://github.com/GoonHouse/Marin0SE/wiki) for help on extending existing behaviors.

* Trosh for [Mari0 SE Documentation](http://guegan.de/mari0doc/index.php) that we took wholesale and started building off in the wiki.
* Qcode for [Mari0 1.6 (Qcode Unofficial) Online](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=4440) that inspired this, even though most the original code was scrapped and gutted. Iterative design at its core, gentlemen.
* Alesan99 for [Alesan99's Entities](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3636) that made us want to do cool things with the foundation we're laying.
* MM102 for [Cookie Clicker Tiles](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?p=84307#p84307) that we're almost certainly going to base custom cursor graphics on.
* Darking and MM102 for [Mario vs Donkey Kong Tiles](http://forum.stabyourself.net/viewtopic.php?p=80272#p80272) that I included mostly for testing purposes and because that's my favorite series.
* [HugoBDesigner](http://hugobdesigner.blogspot.com.br/p/mari0.html) for something, we're not sure what it is yet. We'll tell you when we find out.
* EntranceJew & HammerGuy for welding everything together and installing new floorboards.
* Anyone else that helped that left out! Contact us and we'll be sure to add you.
